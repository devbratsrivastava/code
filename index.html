<p>Some words about me</p>
    <h1>OUR AWESOME EVENTS</h1>
<p>From Coding through days to tech development in the night, we organise event to let the programmers, developer and designers from different domains showcase their expertise and create an extraordinary experience through the learning process. We facilitate various competitive and educational events to instill confidence and pride within the community of computing individuals.</p>
<h5 style="float: left; width: 50%;">DATA STRUCTURE BOOTCAMP</h5>
<h5 style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">Complete data strucure covered</h5>
<p style="float: left; width: 50%;">01.09.2019</p>
<p style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">Data structures bootcamp was a great way of making the students familiar with essentials to gear up for their sem course as well as go beyond that by holding discussions over available repositories and what more is there to explore. The advantages of the bootcamp consisted of students getting thorough with their knowledge on the topic and further develop an interest towards the same, the knowledge that can be gained on the topic is easier processing of data, information to be stored securely on disk very efficiently designing an efficient algorithm, provide management of databases and many more. It was a very enlightening session.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<h5 style="float: left; width: 50%;">Basic C Programming</h5>
<h5 style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">Basics of Programming in C Language</h5>
<p style="float: left; width: 50%;">26.08.2019<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<p style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">Basic C programming sessions were taken up to refresh the programmers on different fundamentals of C language and solved various competitive questions throught the session. One must never forget where they came from, right? It also helped students new in the field of programming learn it thoroughly and gain knowledge from their peers. C is a highly portable structured programming language that can be used for enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations. As a middle level language, C combines the features of both high level and low level languages. Thus students can use it for low level programming like scripting for drivers and kernels and also at the same time use it for high level programming like scripting for software applications.</p>
<h5 style="float: left; width: 50%;">Graphic designing<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></h5>
<h5 style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">CorelDraw, Photoshop and Illustrator covered<br><br><br></h5>
<p style="float: left; width: 50%;">10.08.2019</p>
<p style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">Graphic Designing was a great way of helping creative minds grow their hobby into their skills and was a workshop filled with different ways of showcasing one ideas through vectors and posters. This also helped students to discover where their interest was in the field and continue learning about it. It brought out the aesthetics of students and let them grow uniquely with their own creative ideas getting better with some guidance and support .
As Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography, iconography and illustrations, students under this learn to express their imagination freely, improve social skills , meet new designers and learn new techniques, get better access to resources and also when employed get a stable income.</p>
<h5 style="float: left; width: 50%;">Web Development<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></h5>
<h5 style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">HTML, CSS and JS done<br><br><br></h5>

<p style="float: right; width: 50%; text-align: right;">The web is a dynamic sea of information. A week long web development bootcamp was organised for students to get some idea about web development. They were taught core design principles and front-end fundamentals in HTML and CSS. These core concepts that they developed helped them in further executing projects based on web development and showcasing them on different platforms such as various hackathons and codefests. It enhanced their frontend and backend knowledge and made their skillset more strong in the field of web development. The week long bootcamp also helped them in being consistent with the work that they performed and also clear their doubts as they utilised what they learned daily. Many assignments and quizes were also provided for their practice which boosted their confidence level. It was all in all a very productive session for the students.</p>
